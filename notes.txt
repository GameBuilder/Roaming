place the player into the world, and the starting point
 - the player object
 - enough of the map to show the starting point
 - any objects associated with that pt/region
 - any encounter scripts or other region-logic
 - trigger enter the region
 - trigger enter the tile

the game loads the world location: 
  it gets any game state, starts timers, and so on.
the game loads the player
  it gets any saved location, stats, inventory
the game loads the starting location 
  it returns the region and the current tile
  (we can pass a coord and it resolves this )
