History/Background:

"Once opon a time, in the continent Crucasia, there was a prosperus town called Canchen. 
The town Elder, Corwen, possesed a wood staff with a huge milky pearl held on top by swirling, smooth
branches that had mysterious runes carved on them that no-one, not even the most learned scholars,
could read. Because of this staff, plauges that devastated the rest of the continent avoided Canchen,
any crops grown there never died, and Canchens people were healthy and happy.

But such wealth and its obvious source ( Corwen's staff was well known ) could never pass unnoticed.
