History/Background:

"Once opon a time, in the continent Crucasia, there was a prosperus town called Canchen. 
The town Elder, Corwen, possesed a ancient wood Staff with a huge milky pearl held on top by swirling,
smooth branches that had mysterious runes carved on them that no-one, not even the most learned scholars,
could read. Because of this Staff, plauges that devastated the rest of the continent avoided Canchen,
any crops grown there never died, and Canchens people were healthy and happy.

But such wealth and its obvious source ( Corwen's Staff was well known ) could never pass unnoticed.
One day in the early spring, Canchen was attacked, not by an army, but a monstrus Roc! It was so large
that one of its talons was bigger than a house, and a hundred men could have stood on its back if it had let them.
Its wingbeats destroyed crops and houses alike, and, during the confusion caused by the swirling clouds of
dust generated, it almost casually snached the Staff from Corwen's hands, sending him flying onto the
sharp splinters of a crushed hut.

Once the dust settled, the only thing the people of the town could find were wreckage, devastation... and Corwen's
Staffless corpse

The suvivors, with the wealth that Canchen had accumulated over the years, immediatly purchased enough of the
best weopons and armor they could find to outfit a group of the town's mightyest warriors. The warrior's names
were; Canto, Caldi, Cerchen, Cestrel, Ci, Ciden, Convolt, Colko, Culden, and finally eight-foot-tall Recorent,
who had been appointed leader of the party.
